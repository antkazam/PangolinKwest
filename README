Pangolin Kwest!

A ruby roguelike! It might be ascii, it might be isometric, it might be opengl full 3d! Basically it's all in a state of flux.

At the moment it's opengl. You start it with:
ruby world.rb

You'll get a 3d rotating dungeon in opengl with ugly purple texture mapping but it will be too zoomed in to see anything. You'll need to hold down control and push the mouse forwards or backwards to see the dungeon.
